# Web Front End Placeholder

This directory is reserved for the PoolVision front end.  You can
initialize a React project (e.g., using Vite) here and connect it
to the FastAPI backend defined in `src/api/main.py`.  The front end
should present a live table view, scoreboard overlay, controls for
starting matches and drills, player profiles, and analytics dashboards.
